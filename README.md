# simple-web
a minimal way to browse the web without google ddg or bing spying on us

# whats in it
its pretty simple 
it opens dmenu asks you for a website
then opens it
never going through a search engine
it also has support for ani-cli and youtube
create a file at ~/.config/web/{websites,youtube}
in the websites file place any links you want
in the youtube one place channel names you want
for the youtube file to work your gonna need to find the creators chanel link and add it to the script
good luck
follow the other links for example
